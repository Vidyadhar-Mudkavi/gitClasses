  *File: myHeaders.h

  *Description:

   this file essentially contains some of the header information
   we maintain. for instance, it contains a definition of
   the constant NULL_PTR. we read someplace that NULL is not
   portable. therefore, we define NULL_PTR to be zero and use that
   instead.
